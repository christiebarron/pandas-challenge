    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This report articulates the characteristics and academic performance of the school district for the current academic year. It starts by providing high-level district summary information. It then provides summary information at the school level. It concludes with descriptive statistics describing school performance based on school budget, school size, and school type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary takaways from this report is that the schools in this district have notable variability in their academic performance. Some of this variability seems to be tied to school type, with district schools having notably lower performance in math. Large schools also tend to have moderately lower performance in math. Inferential statistics are required for further insight.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### District Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* The school district has a total of 15 unique schools, 39170 students, and a total budget of $24,649,428. \n",
    "* This year, approximately 74.95% students passed math, 85.81% of students passed reading, and 65.17% of students passed both math and reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### School Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* The average school budget per student ranged from $578 to $655.\n",
    "* All schools demonstrated average math and reading scores that exceeded the 70% cut-off.\n",
    "* Unsurprisingly, the highest performing schools were all charter schools. These schools all had greater than 90% of students passing reading, greater than 90% students passing math, and approximately 84% of students passing reading and math.\n",
    "* The lowest performing schools were all district schools. These schools had approximately 78% of students passing reading, approximately 64% of students passing math, and approximately 50% of students passing both reading and math.\n",
    "* The average percentage of students passing reading and math tended to remain consistent across grades. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Predictors of School Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Budget**: Counterintuitively, schools with higher budgets, did not yield better test results. On the contrary, schools with higher spending 645-675 per student actually underperformed compared to schools with smaller budgets (585 per student). This is likely due to confounding variables such as the socioeconomic status of schools. For instance, schools with large numbers of struggling students due to poor socioeconomic conditions may recieve greater funding to better support their students. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **School Size**: On the whole, smaller size and medium-sized schools performed similarly to each other. However, both smaller and medium-size dschools dramatically out-performed large sized schools on percent passing math (90-91% versus 68%), and percent passing reading and math passing math performances (84% passing vs 55%). \n",
    "\n",
    "* **School Type**: In general, charter schools out-performed the public district schools across all metrics. This effect was more pronounced in math and overall passing rates than reading. Due to several confounding variables, the cause for this effect is uncertain. Charter schools likely have higher SES students, which is one explanation. Additional analysis using methods such as propensity score matching will be required to make valid causal claims, though even multiple regression controlling for school size and school budget would help elucidate this relationship. \n",
